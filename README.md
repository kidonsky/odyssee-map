# Odyssee-map

Version 0.1

This is a project to generate a big intuitive map for the french online game [*Odyss√©e*](https://www.jdr-odyssee.net/odyssee/).
A simple input file is necessary. See `places_example.md` to see the few requirements for the input file.

## Usage

**/!\ Firstly to use this program, you will need a file with all places that you want to put in your map 
(see `places_example.md`).**

- Then you must install requirements  (I recommend to use a Python virtual environment) :

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Finally run the program :

  `python odyssee-map.py -i yourinputfile`

  For more details with options, run `python odyssee-map.py -h`

## Input file 

There are some exigences for the input file. See comments in  `places_example.md`.
